# DOST - The Elite AI Coding Assistant

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

DOST is an autonomous AI coding assistant meticulously engineered to surpass the capabilities of tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Firebase Studio. It's designed for complete self-sufficiency in complex software development tasks, spanning from initial project inception to seamless production deployment. Embodying a 'Master Craftsman' mindset, DOST is driven by a relentless pursuit of first-attempt success, zero-friction development workflows, and the generation of production-ready code.

## :rocket: Core Capabilities

*   **Autonomous Project Initialization:** Define your project goals, and DOST will autonomously set up the project structure, configure build systems, and establish essential development environments.
*   **Intelligent Code Generation:** DOST crafts idiomatic, robust code tailored to your project's language, framework, and architectural patterns. This includes automatic implementation of error handling, comprehensive logging, and rigorous testing.
*   **Automated Dependency Management:** DOST intelligently resolves dependencies, manages conflicts, and ensures seamless integration of required libraries and packages.
*   **Real-Time Error Diagnosis & Resolution:** Leveraging a comprehensive error pattern database, DOST proactively identifies, diagnoses, and resolves errors, often before they manifest as runtime issues.
*   **Performance Optimization:** DOST analyzes and optimizes code for peak performance, employing strategies like caching, compression, lazy loading, and efficient data structures.
*   **Security-First Development:** DOST automatically implements security best practices, encompassing authentication, authorization, data protection, and robust infrastructure security measures.
*   **Comprehensive Testing Automation:** DOST generates a suite of tests, including unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and security tests, ensuring code reliability and resilience.
*   **Streamlined Deployment & DevOps:** DOST auto-generates deployment configurations for platforms like Docker and Kubernetes, automating CI/CD pipelines for seamless releases.
*   **Continuous Learning & Adaptation:** DOST continuously learns from user interactions, emerging technologies, and codebase analysis, adapting its strategies for optimal performance and effectiveness.

## :brain: Intelligent Inference Engine

*   **Project Context Detection:** Automatically detects project context from minimal signals (e.g., file types, package dependencies).
*   **Smart Defaults Matrix:** Applies intelligent defaults for versions, architecture (SOLID principles, clean architecture), security, performance, testing, and DevOps.

## :gear: Autonomous Task Execution

*   **Level 1: Instant Commands (0-5 seconds):** Executes immediately without analysis (e.g., Git operations, package management, build commands, file operations, system queries).
*   **Level 2: Smart Execution (5-30 seconds):** Auto-configures and executes with intelligent defaults (e.g., project initialization, dependency resolution, build system configuration, environment setup, database schema generation).
*   **Level 3: Complex Problem Solving (30 seconds - 5 minutes):** Full analysis, planning, and implementation (e.g., multi-service architecture design, performance optimization, integration testing, security audits).

## :file_folder: Universal Project Templates

DOST utilizes universal project templates for consistency and rapid development. Examples include:

*   **Full-Stack Application Template** (Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure, Documentation, CI/CD)
*   **Microservices Architecture Template** (API Gateway, User Service, Data Service, Notification Service, Shared Components)
