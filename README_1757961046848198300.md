## Overview

DOST is an autonomous AI coding assistant meticulously engineered to surpass the capabilities of tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Firebase Studio. It's designed for complete self-sufficiency in complex software development tasks, spanning from initial project inception to seamless production deployment. Embodying a 'Master Craftsman' mindset, DOST is driven by a relentless pursuit of first-attempt success, zero-friction development workflows, and the generation of production-ready code.

## :rocket: Core Capabilities

*   **Autonomous Project Initialization:** Define your project goals, and DOST will autonomously set up the project structure, configure build systems, and establish essential development environments.
*   **Intelligent Code Generation:** DOST crafts idiomatic, robust code tailored to your project's language, framework, and architectural patterns. This includes automatic implementation of error handling, comprehensive logging, and rigorous testing.
*   **Automated Dependency Management:** DOST intelligently resolves dependencies, manages conflicts, and ensures seamless integration of required libraries and packages.
*   **Real-Time Error Diagnosis & Resolution:** Leveraging a comprehensive error pattern database, DOST proactively identifies, diagnoses, and resolves errors, often before they manifest as runtime issues.
*   **Performance Optimization:** DOST analyzes and optimizes code for peak performance, employing strategies like caching, compression, lazy loading, and efficient data structures.
*   **Security-First Development:** DOST automatically implements security best practices, encompassing authentication, authorization, data protection, and robust infrastructure security measures.
*   **Comprehensive Testing Automation:** DOST generates a suite of tests, including unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and security tests, ensuring code reliability and resilience.
*   **Streamlined Deployment & DevOps:** DOST auto-generates deployment configurations for platforms like Docker and Kubernetes, automating CI/CD pipelines for seamless releases.
*   **Continuous Learning & Adaptation:** DOST continuously learns from user interactions, emerging technologies, and codebase analysis, adapting its strategies for optimal performance and effectiveness.

## Agent Capabilities

*   **Analysis Agent:** Performs in-depth task analysis and validation. It identifies potential issues, clarifies requirements, and ensures the feasibility of proposed solutions. It excels at:
    *   Interpreting error logs and stack traces.
    *   Assessing project structure and identifying potential areas of improvement.
    *   Detecting dependency conflicts and suggesting resolutions.
    *   Identifying performance bottlenecks and recommending optimization strategies.
    *   Recognizing security vulnerabilities and proposing remediation measures.
*   **Coder Agent:** Implements code based on specifications. It generates clean, efficient, and well-documented code, adhering to best practices and project standards. It is skilled at:
    *   Writing new code from scratch based on detailed requirements.
    *   Modifying existing code to fix bugs or add new features.
    *   Refactoring code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
    *   Generating unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality.
    *   Creating documentation to explain code functionality and usage.

## :brain: Intelligent Inference Engine

*   **Project Context Detection:** Automatically detects project context from minimal signals (e.g., file types, package dependencies).
*   **Smart Defaults Matrix:** Applies intelligent defaults for versions, architecture (SOLID principles, clean architecture), security, performance, testing, and DevOps.

## :gear: Autonomous Task Execution

*   **Level 1: Instant Commands (0-5 seconds):** Executes immediately without analysis (e.g., Git operations, package management, buil
