# DOST Multi-Agent Orchestrator

## Overview

The DOST Multi-Agent Orchestrator is an enhanced CLI tool that implements a sophisticated multi-agent system for autonomous software development. It processes natural language requests and executes them using coordinated AI agents working in parallel.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

### 1. Orchestrator Agent
- **Central Controller**: Manages the entire workflow and coordinates between agents
- **Context Management**: Maintains global state and agent-specific contexts
- **Parallel Execution**: Spawns multiple coder agents to work simultaneously
- **Verification**: Ensures all tasks complete successfully and files exist

### 2. Planner Agent  
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaks down natural language requests into structured tasks
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies task dependencies and execution order
- **Resource Planning**: Specifies required files and agent assignments
- **Structured Output**: Returns JSON with task_id, description, required_files, dependencies, agent_type, and priority

### 3. Coder Agents
- **Unique Instances**: Each task gets its own isolated coder agent with unique UUID
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different tasks
- **File Operations**: Creates, edits, and manages files according to task requirements
- **Isolated Context**: Each agent has its own execution context to prevent interference

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Natural Language Processing**: Accepts complex requests in plain English
‚úÖ **Intelligent Task Decomposition**: Breaks down requests into actionable coding tasks
‚úÖ **Parallel Agent Execution**: Multiple coder agents work simultaneously
‚úÖ **Structured Task Format**: Each task includes task_id, description, required_files, dependencies
‚úÖ **File Operations Logging**: Tracks all file creation/modification operations
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Verification**: Verifies task completion and file existence
‚úÖ **Detailed Output**: Saves task_responses.json, workflow.log, and changes.log

## Usage

### Basic Command Structure
```bash
# Using the new orchestrator command
dost orchestrator "Build me a REST API in Go with JWT authentication"

# Using the enhanced root command
dost "Create a simple web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
```

### Example Requests

**REST API Development:**
```bash
dost orchestrator "Build me a REST API in Go with JWT authentication and database integration"
```

**Web Application:**
```bash
dost orchestrator "Create a responsive web application with modern HTML5, CSS3, and interactive JavaScript"
```

**Utility Scripts:**
```bash
dost orchestrator "Create Python utility scripts for data processing with configuration and documentation"
```

**General Programming:**
```bash
dost orchestrator "Implement a calculator program with unit tests"
```

## Workflow Process

1. **Input Processing**: Natural language request is analyzed
2. **Planning Phase**: Planner decomposes request into structured tasks
3. **Agent Spawning**: Unique coder agents are created for each task
4. **Parallel Execution**: All coder agents work simultaneously with isolated contexts
5. **Result Collection**: Responses are collected and aggregated
6. **File Persistence**: Results saved to task_responses.json and workflow files
7. **Verification**: System verifies all tasks completed and required files exist

## Output Files

The system generates workflow management files in the `./dost` directory and code files in the current directory:

**Workflow Management Files (./dost directory):**
- **`task_responses_<workflow_id>.json`**: Detailed responses from each agent
- **`workflow_<workflow_id>.json`**: Complete workflow result with metadata
- **`workflow_<workflow_id>.log`**: Human-readable execution log
- **`changes.log`**: History of all file operations across workflows
- **`shared_context_<workflow_id>.json`**: Shared context between agents

**Generated Code Files (current directory):**
- All source code files (.c, .h, .py, .go, .js, etc.)
- Implementation files
- Test files
- Documentation files related to code

## Task Structure

Each task follows this structured format:

```json
{
  "task_id": "task_abc123_1",
  "description": "Create main.go file with basic HTTP server setup",
  "required_files": ["main.go"],
  "dependencies": [],
  "agent_type": "coder",
  "priority": 5
}
```

## Agent Context Isolation

Each coder agent operates with:
- **Unique UUID**: Prevents agent collision and ensures traceability
- **Isolated Context**: Task-specific context prevents cross-contamination
- **Working Directory**: Dedicated workspace for file operations
- **Execution Tracking**: Individual logging and error handling

## Verification System

The orchestrator verifies:
- ‚úÖ All tasks completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Required files exist on disk
- ‚úÖ File operations completed without errors
- ‚úÖ No missing dependencies or broken workflows

## Error Handling

- **Task-Level**: Individual task failures don't stop other tasks
- **Agent Isolation**: One agent's failure doesn't affect others
- **Retry Logic**: Failed tasks can be identified and retried
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All errors are captured in logs

## Benefits

1. **Speed**: Parallel execution significantly faster than sequential processing
2. **Reliability**: Agent isolation prevents cascading failures
3. **Traceability**: Complete audit trail of all operations
4. **Scalability**: Can handle complex multi-file projects
5. **Flexibility**: Adapts to different types of development requests

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
go run test_workflow.go
```

This will test various request types and validate the complete workflow.

## Architecture Benefits

This implementation follows your exact specifications:

1. ‚úÖ **CLI accepts natural language instructions**
2. ‚úÖ **Orchestrator passes request to Planner** 
3. ‚úÖ **Planner decomposes into structured tasks**
4. ‚úÖ **Unique Coder agent instances spawned for each task**
5. ‚úÖ **Parallel execution with isolated contexts**
6. ‚úÖ **Results collected and persisted to files**
7. ‚úÖ **Orchestrator verification of completion**

The system works like a self-contained AI software engineering team where the Orchestrator manages workflow, Planner creates execution plans, and multiple Coder agents implement solutions in parallel.
